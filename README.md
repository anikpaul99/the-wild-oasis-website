## Project Overview

"The Wild Oasis Website" is designed to offer potential and actual guests a seamless experience while interacting with the boutique hotel. Guests can explore the hotel, learn about its cabins, check availability, and make reservations. The website is built on Next.js, leveraging Supabase as the backend to manage data related to cabins, bookings, and guests.

This website integrates directly with an internal application previously developed for the hotel's staff to manage bookings, cabins, and guest information. Both the internal application and this customer-facing website share the same Supabase database and API. This ensures that any updates made to the cabins or bookings in the internal application are immediately reflected on the customer-facing website.

## Functionality

The Wild Oasis Website offers a variety of features to enhance the user experience for guests:

1. **Explore the Hotel:** Guests can visit the `/about` page to learn more about The Wild Oasis, its offerings, and its ambiance.

2. **View Cabin Information:** The `/cabins` page allows guests to view all available cabins, with the ability to filter cabins by their maximum guest capacity.

3. **Check Cabin Details:** On the `cabins/:cabinId` page, guests can see detailed information about each cabin, including images, amenities, and booked dates.

4. **Make a Reservation:** Guests can reserve a cabin for a specific date range directly from the `cabins/:cabinId` page. Reservations are initially set to 'unconfirmed' and will be confirmed upon arrival at the property.

5. **Manage Reservations:** Logged-in guests can view their reservation history, including past and future bookings, on the `/account/reservations` page. They can also update or delete their reservations from the `/account/reservations/edit/:bookingId` page.

6. **User Authentication:** Guests must sign up and log in before they can make reservations or manage their profiles. Upon signing up, a profile is created in the database, which guests can update to expedite the check-in process.

7. **Profile Management:** Guests can update their profile information on the `/account/profile` page to ensure a smooth check-in experience when they arrive at the hotel.
